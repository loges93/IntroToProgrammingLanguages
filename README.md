This program prompts the user for information regarding their bank account and outputs the interest they would have earned for the initial amount plus any monthly contributions and they interest they would have earned.
The interest is compounded monthly.

I think the layout of the output looks very well and is very legible that the thing I like most considering it is a console application.

To enhance this I would add more options for different frequencies of compounding interest.  Maybe add the ability to have more than one account or different monthly additions based on time of the year.

The monthly compounding took me awhile to get correct I can't remember exactly what the problem was but I had the formula correct I just wasn't outputting the right values.

I think making your output intuitive and easily readable is what I learned most with this project and when wanting to write a quick console application without having to worry about a gui that will be very helpful.

I added many commments and separated concerns so that my main function is not too congested with unreadable jargon.
